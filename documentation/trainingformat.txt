Format of the board:

Title ("Piskvorky" - hard coded. Never changes.) BoardWidth x BoardHeight, 
Player1 Difficulty:Player2 Difficulty, Starting Player
Row Coordinate, Column Coordinate, time taken to make move (ms)
Name of Player 1
Name of Player 2
Error Code

I was able to work this information out by using the source code available from 
Piskvorky on SVN at https://svn.code.sf.net/p/piskvork/code/trunk/
Specifically, https://svn.code.sf.net/p/piskvork/code/trunk/source/game.cpp

The main methods of interest for working this information out were openPsq() and 
savePsq(), along with the methods that these themselves call.

- Width and Height refer to the board and seem to be set in openPsq()
- Difficulty refers to the AI's "level", which determines the skill at which it
plays. See level() method.
- Starting Player. At a glance, can't see how this is determined.
- Coordinates are self explanatory
- Time taken for move
- Player names, written in wrNames()
- Error code: savePsq() is called when a game finishes. The third parameter,
errCode, is what is written as the final line in the training data. For
a standard finish, this is passed in as 0. Our training data files have -1
written as the error code, although I haven't had a chance to look in to this
yet.
