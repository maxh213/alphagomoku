Training data format:
training_data[0] = first game
training_data[0][1][0] = first move of first game
training_data[0][2][0] = second move of first game
training_data[0][0][1] = winner of first game
training_data[0][1][0][0] = first line of first move of first game
training_data[0][1][0][0][0] = first tile on first line of first move of first game

After the training data has been shuffled training data loses the first index above and they're just random moves from any given game
For example:
training_data[0][0] = a move of a random game
training_data[0][1] = winner of the game which the random move was taken from
training_data[1][0] = another move of a random game
and so on...
